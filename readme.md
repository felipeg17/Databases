**Motivation and personal thoughts**
<details><summary>Read it under your own liability</summary><p>

I have been doing a couple of online tutorials, and I have learned some stuff indeed, but after a couple of weeks if I donÂ´t use that knowledge it simply disappears. In order to really 'last', I came back to the roots, to the very beggining, a humble man with just a desire of learning, no prior experience, no degrees, no names.

I started the repos with [ROS tutorials](https://github.com/fegonzalez7/rob_unal_clase2), it kinda worked, actually they are my legacy on robotics, but now I want something for myself. A couple of things:
 - **Why english?:** The real answer shoul be why not?...I need to improve it.
 - **Why DB and SQL?:** Because a do not know a da*m thing about it, so I am starting from scratch.
 - **Why a repo poorly coded and badly commented?:** Well, there should be probably hundreds of books about these topics, but there are not mine, plus this is my way.

 *Disclaimer:* I will never say that a random [*chick*](https://github.com/ariasAleia?tab=repositories) was right about this. It seems that I am recovering the licence to <*insert some sh#t*>.
